####Homework:

######Non-Code
a) Start thinking about your final piece and bring in a description of it to talk to your classmates. It can be code or just paper sketches. Your final for this class has simples rules:

1. It needs to involve code and movement.
2. It needs to look like a finished piece. It cannot be just an "experiment".
3. You need to burn a hole in my brain so I'll remember you forever.

Things that are OPTIONAL:

1. Use your language of choice. OF is optional.
2. It does not need to be interactive or real time. It can be a video or even still images as long as it involved code and movement at some point.

######Code
a) Bring one of the previous class themes to 3D space... How about a 3D flow field? 3D Forces? 3D Physics libraries? 3D orbits?

b) Make a mesh interactive. It can be to camera, sound, mouse, keys, anything.
