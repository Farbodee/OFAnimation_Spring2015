####Homework:

######Code
a) Imagine other ways of setting a flow field. We used randomness and noise, but could you affect it using audio? Maybe using a mouse drag? Could a flow field be dynamic and move over time? How does a 3D flow field look like? Use your imagination.

b) Work with the particles for maximum beauty out of a flowfield. Try using alpha values, different sizes, different ways of drawing. Changing colors over time. Again, use your imagination.
